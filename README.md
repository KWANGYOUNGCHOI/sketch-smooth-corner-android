# sketch-smooth-corner-android

An android project explained how to draw Sketch's smooth corner in android canvas

* High Performance
* Dynamic Corners

Aslo you can try it in this [web demo](http://www.martinrgb.com/sketch-smooth-corner-web) —— compare uploaded image with effect in **Web Canvas **

## Parameter comparison

If the round radius is bigger than **90% of the shortest edge** ,there will be tiny difference between real value in **Sketch** and the output value in **Andoird** (But in that case,I would use **Round Corners**)
